<a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/25511">https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/25511</a>.</p>
<p>Michael: We have another security release with logjam fixes scheduled for
v0.12, so that&#39;s ok with me to move that until next couple of v0.10/v0.12
releases.</p>
<p>Julien: I might have time to start the release process for v0.10.29 today.
Once v0.10 is released, I can move on to releasing v0.12.5.</p>
<h4 id="header-node-v0-12-5">node v0.12.5<a name="node-v0-12-5" class="anchor" href="#node-v0-12-5" aria-labelledby="header-node-v0-12-5"></a></h4><p>Julien: We have <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/25517">a PR to upgrade npm to
2.11.2</a>. It seems to be a small
change from the current version, so I would advocate for landing that now.</p>
<p>Michael: Playing devil&#39;s advocate: would it delay the OpenSSL upgrade? If so,
then we could postpone it to 0.12.6. If the risk is low, and it&#39;s fairly quick
to land it, I&#39;m ok with that.</p>
<p>Julien: Breaking changes for v0.12: the OpenSSL upgrade prevents TLS clients
to connect to servers that use DH params with keys that are too short to be
safe.</p>
<p>Michael: Yes, and deferring the change to prevent servers to use shorter keys
until next release.</p>
<h3 id="header-moving-this-weekly-call-to-the-lts-wg-call">Moving this weekly call to the LTS WG call<a name="moving-this-weekly-call-to-the-lts-wg-call" class="anchor" href="#moving-this-weekly-call-to-the-lts-wg-call" aria-labelledby="header-moving-this-weekly-call-to-the-lts-wg-call"></a></h3><p>Julien: We have <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/LTS/issues/6#issuecomment-112976451">a new
doodle</a> to try
to come up with the best time slot to have these meetings, please fill it out
if you haven&#39;t yet.</p>
<h3 id="header-having-more-than-one-person-managing-releases">Having more than one person managing releases<a name="having-more-than-one-person-managing-releases" class="anchor" href="#having-more-than-one-person-managing-releases" aria-labelledby="header-having-more-than-one-person-managing-releases"></a></h3><p>Julien: having only one person who manage releases is not sustainable, I would
like to have a team of release managers for v0.10.x and v0.12.x releases, and
future LTS releases.</p>
<p>Julien: I&#39;ve made some good progress on documenting the release process and
improving some of the build scripts and Jenkins jobs to make them usable by
other people than me. Hopefully that will be ready not too long from now.</p>
<p>Julien: In the meantime, I&#39;d like to raise that to the broader LTS group and
see who would be interested in being a release manager.</p>
<p>Steven: I have some experience with releases in the ICU project and other open
source projects, so I can definitely help, even to review and give feedback on
the release process.</p>
<p>Julien: I&#39;ll create an issue in nodejs/LTS to gather initial feedback and see
who could be interested.</p>
<h3 id="header-deprecation-of-shorter-keys-in-dh-param-server-side">Deprecation of shorter keys in DH param server side<a name="deprecation-of-shorter-keys-in-dh-param-server-side" class="anchor" href="#deprecation-of-shorter-keys-in-dh-param-server-side" aria-labelledby="header-deprecation-of-shorter-keys-in-dh-param-server-side"></a></h3><p>Michael: The OpenSSL upgrade to 1.0.1o prevents clients from connecting to
servers using DH parameters that have a key that is too small to be safe. We
should deprecate passing DH params that are unsafe when creating TLS servers
too. I suggested <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/25509#issuecomment-112596586">some changes to do that on
GitHub</a>,
could you please provide feedback on these changes?</p>
<h3 id="header-transition-from-v0-12-to-next-converged-lts-release">Transition from v0.12 to next converged LTS release<a name="transition-from-v0-12-to-next-converged-lts-release" class="anchor" href="#transition-from-v0-12-to-next-converged-lts-release" aria-labelledby="header-transition-from-v0-12-to-next-converged-lts-release"></a></h3><p>Michael: Julien started documenting breaking changes between v0.12.x and
what&#39;s currently in the converged repository. Julien, is there any way we can help?</p>
<p>Julien: Documenting the changes is really the first step. What I need from you
and other members of the LTS working group is to review this list and give
feedback. Once we&#39;re confident that we have an accurate list of breaking
changes, the next step is to reach out to various user communities and
determine what we need to do to make the transition as smooth as possible.</p>
<p>Michael: It seems that there were some productive discussions during Nodeconf
about requirements from users regarding LTS releases.</p>
<p>Julien: Yes, and there are other additional ways we can reach out to the
broader community: leveraging the Node.js Advisory Board, reaching out to
Joyent&#39;s Node.js Incubator participants, the broader community on GitHub, etc.
We will need some coordination between a lot of entities within the Node.js
project.</p>
<p>Michael: I would suggest reaching out to nan maintainers to identify V8
breaking changes that would be handled by nan.</p>
<p>Julien: Sounds like a good idea!</p>
<p>Michael: Maybe instead of commenting in an existing issue, Julien could create
new issue on GitHub to get more attention with all details that he
mentioned.</p>
<p>Julien: agreed.</p>
<p>Julien: One other thing that I&#39;d like to use to make the transition even
smoother is release candidates. I had started some work around that a while
ago and unfortunately I haven&#39;t had the time to continue working on it. I
think that Rod Vagg did some work around that for io.js and it might be ready
there. Anyway, having release candidates for the next cycle of LTS releases
would probably make things easier.</p>
<p>Michael: Definitely, this is a broader topic for the LTS working group that we
should probably even consider separately.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/25087">https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/25087</a>, same upgrade code used for 32/64 bit which is not good practice.  Can result in binaries from one (32/64) being put into the other.  Will move to use 2 upgrade codes, but this will break upgrade. Going to add manual action to check for old code and give message saying you cannot upgrade and that you should un-install and install again</p>

joyent/node, or should all discussions be moved to the combined Node.js TSC
meeting?</p>
<p>James: Still has value in the short term. Maybe have them not every week but
when needed?</p>
<p>Michael: Maybe part of the LTS working group?</p>
<p>Colin: Need to make sure we bring joyent/node issues to the combined TSC call,
during the last two calls we had no discussions around joyent/node.</p>
<p>Julien: For instance adding collaborators from io.js to joyent/node is a topic
that I&#39;d like to discuss in the combined call.</p>
<p>Michael: Actually another topic could be this very discussion that we have now
about transitioning this weekly call into the LTS working group call.</p>
<p>Action item: propose during next combined TSC call that this weekly call be
transitioned to the LTS working group call.</p>
<h3 id="header-upgrade-to-libuv-1-6-0">Upgrade to libuv 1.6.0<a name="upgrade-to-libuv-1-6-0" class="anchor" href="#upgrade-to-libuv-1-6-0" aria-labelledby="header-upgrade-to-libuv-1-6-0"></a></h3><p>Julien: the issue with OSX and tty is not severe to me. It&#39;s been present
since v0.11.12, happens on OSX only and is specific to TTY handling.</p>
<p>Michael: It seems that there&#39;s no need to rush the next v0.12.x release for
this particular issue, we should aim at including the fix in the next one when
it&#39;s ready.</p>
<p>James, Colin, Julien: agreed.</p>
<h3 id="header-security-report-from-hp">Security report from HP<a name="security-report-from-hp" class="anchor" href="#security-report-from-hp" aria-labelledby="header-security-report-from-hp"></a></h3><p>Julien: HP recently sent a security report mentioning potential security

on vacation for the next 2 weeks so I&#39;ll do my best to take it from there.
We&#39;ll revert what&#39;s landed in v0.10 so far to prevent this from holding back
other changes, and submit a new single PR that contains all changes so that
there&#39;s only one place to comment.</p>
<p>Michael: If you need help with this just let us know.</p>

<ul>
<li>breaking v8 change <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/25324">https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/25324</a> - have PR ready</li>
<li>Windows XP issues, have pull request from io.js, ready to pull over</li>
</ul>
<p>James also has RC4/Bar Mitzvah fix ready to go back in as well</p>
<p>If time permits Alexis will do more investigation to identify what caused the XP issue</p>
<h3 id="header-npm-testing">npm testing<a name="npm-testing" class="anchor" href="#npm-testing" aria-labelledby="header-npm-testing"></a></h3><p>Michael: update to npm 2.8.4 broke our test-npm target.  PR to fix is here: 
<a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/25290">https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/25290</a>.  Previously you could run tests without
install but now install is required or tests don&#39;t run. </p>
<p>Julien: we shoul talk with npm team on how to make sure the best way to run the tests</p>
<p>Action: Michael to follow up with Forrest Norvell to discuss</p>
<h3 id="header-lts">LTS<a name="lts" class="anchor" href="#lts" aria-labelledby="header-lts"></a></h3><p>James: Some concern over moving directly to next LTS based on converged repo, we may need
to allow for a 0.14.X</p>
<p>After discussion we agreed that we need to provide more information so that people have
a better idea of what will be changing and the impact.  More specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>gather list of breaking changes that will be in converged repo so that we can document
and better communicate what will be different</p>
</li>
<li><p>reach out broadly to users to gather input on what their specific concerns might be
in terms of an LTS release, including timing, content etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall we want to figure out what the right answer is and be open to that alternative.</p>
<p>Action: James will push on these 2 aspects. </p>
<h3 id="header-deprecation">Deprecation<a name="deprecation" class="anchor" href="#deprecation" aria-labelledby="header-deprecation"></a></h3><p>There was some discussion about how a platform would be deprecated.  One suggestion was that for 
platforms that no longer have vendor support (ex Windows XP) we would deprecate.  It might also
be appropriate for non-core platforms if there is nobody actively maintaining them.   It is a relatively
complex issue so Alexis will open an issue on github (in the LTS repo) to discuss.</p>
<h3 id="header-logjam">Logjam<a name="logjam" class="anchor" href="#logjam" aria-labelledby="header-logjam"></a></h3><p><a href="https://weakdh.org/">https://weakdh.org/</a></p>
<p>James/Julien had run tools provided in report against Node 0.10.X and 0.12.X and they don&#39;t report an
issue so its only the second part which applies.  This is related to allowing short key lengths. 
There are already some patches in io.js that may be pulled across although we likely would want a 
fallback option that they may not contain.  Based on the report we want to move this forward but
its not urgent. </p>

Current npm version (2.7.4) is broken for a lot of users. npm 2.8.4 fixes a
lot of issues.
The reason why we didn&#39;t catch it, the current makefile doesn&#39;t trigger an
error if you don&#39;t have CouchDB installed. It just gives a warning, that&#39;s
easy to miss.</p>
<p>Going to open a PR to make sure we catch these issues.</p>
<p>Michael:
Made some progress on Jenkins job that runs npm tests. Currently passes
only on OSX. I&#39;ll keep working on it.</p>
<p>Julien:
CouchDB is the server for the npm registry. There are some tests that perform
requests to CouchDB. If not installed, the tests don&#39;t run.
CouchDB needs to be installed on each of the Jenkins machines.</p>

Trevor working on it. Might not make it for the next 0.12 release.</p>
<h4 id="header-rc4-deprecation">RC4 deprecation<a name="rc4-deprecation" class="anchor" href="#rc4-deprecation" aria-labelledby="header-rc4-deprecation"></a></h4><p>James, Julien:
Need to address the problem if cyphers is undefined or null.
Need to do a last pass on the pull request, to review tests/documentation.
If we can nail this by end of week, we could make the next release next Tuesday.
If we can&#39;t land the RC4 fixes, maybe we should revert the existing fixes for
now. And do the release. And make the RC4 fixes in the next release.</p>
<p>James: we should be able to finish the work this week.
If delayed just a day, we&#39;ll wait.</p>

the PRs on the list.</p>
<p>Julien: try to sprint until Friday. We only want to land stuff that meets the
usual quality bar.</p>
<p>James: once RC4 issues are fixed in 0.12, we should be able to land them in
0.10.39.</p>
<p>Julien: start in 0.10.39, then port to 0.12.</p>
<p>Julien: Alexis, your PR should be added to to the 0.10.39 milestone.
<a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/25100">https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/25100</a></p>
<p>Julien:
For 10.39, there&#39;s also a fix for timers:
<a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/17203">https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/17203</a>
First fix was already reviewed. Then I submitted a simpler fix. Looking for a
second review.
It shouldn&#39;t hold up the release, but it should be pretty safe and it fixes
some annoying issues.</p>
<h3 id="header-flaky-tests-support">Flaky tests support<a name="flaky-tests-support" class="anchor" href="#flaky-tests-support" aria-labelledby="header-flaky-tests-support"></a></h3><p>Alexis: io.js removed support for flaky tests. <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/812">https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/812</a>
It looks like this issue might be slightly controversial.
I am guessing they thought it was a mechanism for ignoring test failures in
general, while it is only meant to support the automatic merge in
node-accept-pull-request.</p>
<p>Julien:
In io.js they run CI to test every pull request, but they do the merge manually.
io.js folks mentioned not been able to change the commit message as a downside
of node-accept-pull-request.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s communicate why it&#39;s useful.
We should definitely log issues for flaky tests.</p>
<p>Colin: how about policy for removing the test out of flaky -say- after a week?
Somebody has to fix it. Or it should be deleted from the tests.</p>
<p>Alexis, Julien: The moment we mark a test as flaky, we should open an issue
and treat it as high priority.</p>
<h3 id="header-node-js-api-working-group">Node.js API working group<a name="node-js-api-working-group" class="anchor" href="#node-js-api-working-group" aria-labelledby="header-node-js-api-working-group"></a></h3><p>Alexis: there was a request for participation in this working group. Do you
know more about the charter of this working group?</p>
<p>Julien:
Dan Shaw has been trying to get together a group people for a standard on what
an official Node.js API is.
Maybe to enable people to implement another runtime that is compatible with
Node.</p>
<p>Is the working group about the external or the internal API?</p>
<p>James to seek more clarifications on the email thread.</p>
<h3 id="header-convergence-process">Convergence process<a name="convergence-process" class="anchor" href="#convergence-process" aria-labelledby="header-convergence-process"></a></h3><p>Alexis: in anticipation of the convergence work, where should we make changes?
Node, io, and/or convergence repo?</p>
<p>James: when we do our next major release, is it going to be based on
the convergence repo? If so, that&#39;s where we should be landing the new
features.</p>
<p>Michael: But it won&#39;t be in stable working conditions for a while.
So until we get the CI, we still do it in Node.</p>
<p>If we make a change in joyent/node master, we can also port it to the
convergence repo.</p>
<p>Colin: what if we started cherry picking stuff to io.js?</p>
<p>James: that works too.</p>
<p>Julien: still a lot users of 0.12</p>
<p>James: are we going to cut new releases from joyent\node master? </p>
<p>Julien: not a lot of work in master at this time.</p>
<p>Julien: Still waiting for io.js to vote on whether they want to merge.</p>
<p>James: possible alternate routes. If they choose not to come into the
foundation, we can still fork io.js and use it as our own converged stream.
We still need to give it some thought.</p>
<p>Michael: agree with Julien on deferring until io.js decision takes place.</p>
<h3 id="header-triaging-issues">Triaging issues:<a name="triaging-issues" class="anchor" href="#triaging-issues" aria-labelledby="header-triaging-issues"></a></h3><p>Julien: how to do a better job at triaging issues coming in on github.
948 issues open. A lot more coming in.
Hard to triage them all, let alone fix them.
Could we spend a little time every day to review the issues?</p>
<p>Michael: schedule a slot to do everything together.</p>
<p>Robert: using this process in CouchDB with very good results.</p>
<p>Robert: we are using Jira.</p>
<p>Alexis: increase the bandwidth by doing it in smaller groups or
individually?</p>
<p>Julien: good team exercise to do it together.</p>
<p>Robert: let&#39;s just try it for a few weeks and see how it goes.</p>
<p>Julien: schedule something just to try it out, see if it works.</p>
<p>Everybody: ok :)</p>
<p>Alexis: we&#39;ll need to find a way to use github effectively.</p>
<p>Michael: I assume we can invite other people too.</p>
<p>Julien: it&#39;s also a good way to onboard additional contributors.</p>
<p>Schedule first meeting with existing collaborators. And if it works, we can
extend it to more collaborators.</p>
<p>Julien: any volunteers to lead this? If not I&#39;ll do it.</p>
<p>Julien: maybe we can use Slack?</p>
<p>Alexis: I vote for slack.</p>
<p>Colin: +1 for Slack.</p>

This must probably be
considered before releasing the other changes to the default ciphers lists
that have already landed in v0.10.</p>
<h5 id="header-timer-fixes">Timer fixes<a name="timer-fixes" class="anchor" href="#timer-fixes" aria-labelledby="header-timer-fixes"></a></h5><p>Julien: Current PR here: <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/17203">https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/17203</a>.</p>
<p>Julien: Need more feedback on whether to land this in v0.10.39. Recent changes
to the timers module broke a lot of users in the past few v0.10.x releases, so
we definitely need to be careful. This one seems safer than the previous ones
though.</p>

floating patch to fix let bindings in for loops
(<a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/23948">https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/23948</a>).</p>

significant issues (including security issues). We will want to include an
upgraded version of npm with the next v0.12 release. Will review this PR and
land if tests pass and that version is still what makes sense.</p>
<p>Michael: We could probably create a Jenkins job to run the test-npm make target.</p>

decision about it sooner than later:
<a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/9195">https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/9195</a>.</p>
<p>James: I would suggest updating the docs in 0.12, and wait to have more input
to maybe make a change in behavior on master.</p>
<p>Colin and ALL: agreed.</p>
<h3 id="header-convergence-plan">Convergence plan<a name="convergence-plan" class="anchor" href="#convergence-plan" aria-labelledby="header-convergence-plan"></a></h3><p>James: Initial convergance plan: <a href="https://github.com/jasnell/dev-policy/pull/66">https://github.com/jasnell/dev-policy/pull/66</a>.</p>
<p>James: nothing set in stone. Current plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>io.js organization transferred to nodejs organization. Will keep everything
they&#39;ve already setup.</li>
<li>joyent/node and other joyent/node-related repos will also be transferred to
this organization.</li>
<li>Both joyent/node and iojs/iojs repos would be under the foundation.</li>
<li>For the converged repo, a fork of iojs repo would be created.</li>
<li>New repo would be the next major release.</li>
</ul>
<p>James: Details for LTS policies still need to be figured out.</p>
<p>James: Next work will be focused on the CI infrastructure.</p>
<p>James: most importantly, need to agree that the merging process will be io.js
forked and picking changes from joyent/node.</p>
<p>James: Will also need to catalog other resources like twitter handles, domain
names, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Action Item:</strong> Julien to send James the list of assets used by the current
CI platform.</p>
<h3 id="header-intl">Intl<a name="intl" class="anchor" href="#intl" aria-labelledby="header-intl"></a></h3><p>James: io.js not OK with current intl support in v0.12 due to lack of
modularity and issues around new command line switches.</p>
<p>James: Putting together a plan that would make sense so that we can track that
refactoring. Would be targeted to 0.13, and would make it more palatable for
the io.js team.</p>
<p>Steven: Concerns around the data size, confident that this proposal will
improve the user experience.</p>
<p>Steven: What it doesn&#39;t address is splitting the data in micro pieces. Not
convinced by the use case for that, especially due to the amount of work
required.</p>
<p>James: In discussions witb Bert and others to know what the use cases are for
the modularity.</p>
<p>Michael: On board with being able to install data from npm, but not sure what
the</p>
<p>Steven: Two different types of usage: desktop of server. ICU point of view is
to support user&#39;s language on the desktop and whatever comes on the wire in
the server model.</p>
<p>James, Steven: Working group about i18n will likely be created in the Node.js
foundation, more discussions about that in upcoming convergence meetings.</p>

Progress
being made, need to update to clarify precedence of command line 
options (<a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/19148">https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/19148</a>), update code/tests to 
match this description (James), finalize release notes (Julien with input from all) 
and then do one final review before release (all).   Important that we add
tests to make sure merge with 0.12.X can be easily validated.</p>
<h4 id="header-v0-12-3">v0.12.3<a name="v0-12-3" class="anchor" href="#v0-12-3" aria-labelledby="header-v0-12-3"></a></h4><p>Same discussion of removal of RC4 to address Bar Mitzva attack.  Just need
to do commits in a way that facilitates merge from 0.10.X later</p>
<p>Julien: looking at completing V8 lateral upgrade.  Will be v0.12.3 unless
removal of RC4 is ready before it is.</p>
<h3 id="header-internationalization">Internationalization<a name="internationalization" class="anchor" href="#internationalization" aria-labelledby="header-internationalization"></a></h3><p>James: io.js looking at Globalize as an alternative, because they would like
it to be more modular in terms of how features (like collation)/languages get pulled in.</p>
<p>If the two code bases are merged not including ICU would be a forced break.  Current
understanding is that merged code base would be everything from both code bases.<br>If instead individual pieces are not going to be included then likely convergence working 
group would need to build list to cover these pieces and work through an appropriate
approach to deal with each one. </p>
<p>In advance, we should start looking to see if we can make the inclusion of ICU more
modular in a non breaking way.  Action: Michael to setup meeting with Steven/James
to better understand dependencies between startup and V8 with respect to ICU.</p>

core from Javascript engine and multi-isolate support might be starting point
for Node.  JxCore team seems interested in collaborating.  Next logical step
likely to form working group in Foundation to cover these two. </p>
<p>TJ: We should also be looking at formalizing the internal layer (for example 
TCPWrap) as part of introducing the required separation.</p>
<h3 id="header-dev-policy">Dev Policy<a name="dev-policy" class="anchor" href="#dev-policy" aria-labelledby="header-dev-policy"></a></h3><p>James: looking to add some representation for user requirements. Proposed a working

<li>v0.12.3 status.</li>
<li>dev policy sync before meeting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="header-rc4-vulnerability">RC4 vulnerability<a name="rc4-vulnerability" class="anchor" href="#rc4-vulnerability" aria-labelledby="header-rc4-vulnerability"></a></h3><p>We want to iterate a few more times before we release.</p>
<p>James has a new set of PRs for review.</p>
<p>Julien ran the ssl upgrade test, and found a potential security issue.</p>
<p>There is an additional note for getLegacyCiphers, throwing for an unknown
string.</p>
<p>How do we want to release this? Is it separate, or should we include it along
with a blog post and documentation about the changes?</p>
<p>IBM security identified it as being important enough to have a fix.</p>
<p>Are we doing our normal v0.12.3 gestation, or are we doing a v0.12.2 with only
this fix?</p>
<p>io.js updated their defaults a month ago.</p>
<p>Continue conversation on email and make a decision on the release for Monday.</p>
<p>This particular issue should be handled for v0.10.39, but for v0.12.3 we
include what has been already landed.</p>
<p>Potential Security Issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Julien will send an email to security@ with a description for a discussion.</li>
<li>Validate the concerns of this issue and determine if it should be included
with the RC4 fix.</li>
</ul>
<p>IBM runs a lot of tests on multiple platforms for their releases, and the RC4
fixes for v0.10 have been internally validated.</p>
<p>James is looking at improving the SSL/TLS cipher test suite</p>
<h3 id="header-v0-12-3">v0.12.3<a name="v0-12-3" class="anchor" href="#v0-12-3" aria-labelledby="header-v0-12-3"></a></h3><p>Not much has changed since last week, as many people were working on
Foundation pieces.</p>
<p>Many of the P-1 issues can be easily managed once we have more time.</p>
<p>Are any small enough for inclusion before Monday.</p>
<p>A FreeBSD fix still needs more iteration.</p>
<p>Ideally we continue focusing on the RC4 and related security issues.</p>
<p>No one has indicated being blocked on others.</p>
<h3 id="header-release-candidate-work">Release Candidate work<a name="release-candidate-work" class="anchor" href="#release-candidate-work" aria-labelledby="header-release-candidate-work"></a></h3><p>Julien submitted a PR to describe the policy.</p>
<p>Ideally running the release of v0.12.4 in this policy.</p>
<p>Some platform providers are not sure about the RC portion will be useful for
them.</p>
<p>TJ would like to introduce the Yahoo team to Julien to see if they&#39;d be
interested in release candidates.</p>
<p>Also would be good to reach out to Forrest for npm mechanisms.</p>
<p>node-gyp still relies on the internet.</p>
<h3 id="header-windows-msi-install">Windows MSI install<a name="windows-msi-install" class="anchor" href="#windows-msi-install" aria-labelledby="header-windows-msi-install"></a></h3><p>We should look to unify on install.py and the location.</p>
<p>Deployment on windows is particularly hard.</p>
<p>Compilers for production deployments is odd.</p>
<p>JXCore has an API/ABI shim and engine abstraction layer.</p>
<h3 id="header-development-policy">Development Policy<a name="development-policy" class="anchor" href="#development-policy" aria-labelledby="header-development-policy"></a></h3><p>Meeting today at 12PM PDT.</p>
<p>Work between James and Mikeal on describing the iojs policy and adding in the
things that the Node.js core team cares about.</p>
<p>Trying to walk the line and balance innovation and speed with stability.</p>
<p>The core team needs to provide feedback, before and during the meeting.</p>
<p>Convergence Working Group would merge the code bases between iojs and Node.js,
in the mean time the projects would work independently.</p>
<p>The potential release number would be 2.0.0.</p>

<p>TJ: Now could be a good time for everyone to talk about tools they know that
would work well to help the work done by the foundation.</p>
<h3 id="header-benchmarks">Benchmarks<a name="benchmarks" class="anchor" href="#benchmarks" aria-labelledby="header-benchmarks"></a></h3><p>Michael: We&#39;d like to have tools to make sure there&#39;s no performance
regression between releases.</p>
<p>Michael: We could use <a href="https://github.com/acmeair/acmeair">https://github.com/acmeair/acmeair</a>, and there&#39;s a
Node.js version: <a href="https://github.com/acmeair/acmeair-nodejs">https://github.com/acmeair/acmeair-nodejs</a>.</p>
<p>Michael: Have talked to maintainer of acme-air and they are willing to
collaborate, we could also get them to give us an intro to the benchmark if
that makes sense.</p>
<p>TJ: We also want a benchmark specifically for low-latency and high
concurrency.</p>
<p>TJ: How do we want to start with that? Also should assess what we already have.</p>
<p>Michael: Might want to form a performance working group.</p>
<p>Michael: Good idea to reach out to io.js too.</p>
<p>TJ to forward to Michael contacts at Yahoo, Netflix and Paypal that might be
interested in participating.</p>
<h3 id="header-oob-osx">OOB OSX<a name="oob-osx" class="anchor" href="#oob-osx" aria-labelledby="header-oob-osx"></a></h3><p>v0.10.37 fixed an issue in kqueue regarding out of band data. The reporter
never heard back from Apple, and no CVE  has been assigned. Could lead to a
DOS scenario.</p>
<h3 id="header-security-issue-in-vm-js">Security issue in vm.js<a name="security-issue-in-vm-js" class="anchor" href="#security-issue-in-vm-js" aria-labelledby="header-security-issue-in-vm-js"></a></h3><p>TJ: Got an email about a user concerned about the fact that the parent of a
sliced buffer can be traversed across VMs.</p>
<p>Trevor: this has been known for a while.</p>
<p>TJ: sandbox is a not a security context sandbox, but more a &quot;programming
sandbox&quot;.</p>
<p>TJ: In my opinion, mostly a documentation bug on our part.</p>

What link would we use?</p>
<p>James: We have a landing page for this SDK for Node.js. Easiest thing would be
to land to this page.</p>
<p>TJ: I want to avoid confusion if the versions are not in sync between the two
projects.</p>
<p>James: We can make it clear on this landing page.</p>
<p>TJ: Can the additional debugging stuff be upstreamed?</p>
<p>Michael: We want to make that available, maybe via npm. Same for IDDE.</p>
<p>TJ: Would be great to have the additional debugging support in the code base
too, so that people can load core files from z platforms and do debugging.</p>
<h2 id="header-releases">Releases<a name="releases" class="anchor" href="#releases" aria-labelledby="header-releases"></a></h2><h3 id="header-v0-10-38">v0.10.38<a name="v0-10-38" class="anchor" href="#v0-10-38" aria-labelledby="header-v0-10-38"></a></h3><p>Julien: Would be great to document how to upgrade OpenSSL.</p>
<p>James: Had an item in my todo list to do that.</p>
<p>Julien: We can team up to do that.</p>
<p>TJ: I would suggest to start shipping an alternate binary linked with shared
dynamic libraries for libuv, OpenSSL, etc.</p>
<p>TJ: Might be difficult to do that for dependencies where we have floating
patches.</p>
<h3 id="header-v0-12-2">v0.12.2<a name="v0-12-2" class="anchor" href="#v0-12-2" aria-labelledby="header-v0-12-2"></a></h3><p>Julien: New P-1 issue added: debugger is very slow, takes 1 or 2 minutes to do
basic operations, see <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/9125">https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/9125</a> for more
information.</p>
<p>Trevor: There&#39;s a major issue with buffer
(<a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/9180">https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/9180</a>) that causes asserts for a lot of
users, can we get a v0.12.2 release asap with the current state of v0.12, and
move everything else from the 0.12.2 milestone to 0.12.3?</p>
<p>Julien: We may also want to add an upgrade to npm 2.7.3 for this release.</p>
<p>Trevor: See also <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/14165">https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/14165</a>.</p>
<p>No objection from anyone.</p>

with them around potential improvements to the cluster module.</p>
<h2 id="header-crypto-performance">Crypto performance<a name="crypto-performance" class="anchor" href="#crypto-performance" aria-labelledby="header-crypto-performance"></a></h2><p>James: Interested in getting some work to propose enhancements to crypto
performance. What do you think about adding async mechanisms to crypto?</p>
<p>TJ: Could have a discussion of what we&#39;d like as an async API. Could also
broaden the discussion to a long term goal of having better TLS performance.
That will be even more important with HTTP/2.</p>
<p>James: Can start the conversation with a proposal of improvements.</p>
<h2 id="header-website">Website<a name="website" class="anchor" href="#website" aria-labelledby="header-website"></a></h2><p>TJ: We&#39;ll have a new single certificate with support for subdomains.</p>

<h2 id="header-discussion">Discussion<a name="discussion" class="anchor" href="#discussion" aria-labelledby="header-discussion"></a></h2><p>New Openssl vulnerabilities reported today. Important but not a panic. Node
uses openssl 1.0.1  and higher severity issues were reported against 1.0.2.
James will create pull request and we&#39;d like to see the update go out either
Friday (torrow) or Monday.</p>
<p>We discussed different options and agreed that 0.10.38 will be the same as
0.10.37 plus the new openssl level and similarlty 0.12.1 will be the same as
0.12.0 plus the new openssl level.</p>
<p>There was some discussion about including the changes that have gone into the
existing 0.12.1 branch but we agreed it was best not to do this.</p>

have a look at it to see if he can help out.</p>
<p>Libuv upgrade, should be ready just need to run accept job to pull it in.</p>
<p>Michael raised issue 9439 which covers a patch to v8 to bring profiling
for 0.12.X back up to the level of 0.10.X. TJ identified that the next
steps for 0.12.2 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Libuv update.</li>
<li>Lateral V8 change.</li>
<li>floating patches for v8.</li>
<li>Look at adding the floating patch for 9439.</li>

At this point
we should be using the node-accept-pull-request jenkins jobs to
accept/validate pull requests. Julien will add to node websites the parts we
are putting into use. Next to be added is nomination for milestones which
we&#39;ll probably start using in a couple of weeks.</p>
<h3 id="header-general">General<a name="general" class="anchor" href="#general" aria-labelledby="header-general"></a></h3><h4 id="header-next-v8-upgrade">Next V8 upgrade<a name="next-v8-upgrade" class="anchor" href="#next-v8-upgrade" aria-labelledby="header-next-v8-upgrade"></a></h4><p>Michael asked about how we&#39;d choose the next V8 version. TJ confirmed it would
most likely be the current stable V8 level when 0.13/0.14 get started, however
there are issues around the toolset needed to support the latest V8 releases
and how we can maintain support for older OS levels might affect this.</p>
<h4 id="header-icu-crash-issue-9361">ICU crash - Issue 9361<a name="icu-crash-issue-9361" class="anchor" href="#icu-crash-issue-9361" aria-labelledby="header-icu-crash-issue-9361"></a></h4><p>Fix for this is already integrated in a later V8 version. Steven Loomis is
looking at this and there is a pull request ready to backport the existing
fix. There was some discussion about the best approach and in the end we
agreed the existing fix is appropriate and we should just backport it to
0.12.2.</p>
<h4 id="header-testing-release-candidates">Testing release candidates<a name="testing-release-candidates" class="anchor" href="#testing-release-candidates" aria-labelledby="header-testing-release-candidates"></a></h4><p>Julien is talking with some groups about doing some pre-release testing on
release candidates. TJ suggested we should ask for volunteers on the blog or
twitter. It will need to be a full blown release candidate due to gyp
dependencies etc. Julien will write up a proposal.</p>

more investigation/discussion is required before doing anything.</p>

Heroku and New Relic to have it tested. Once I hear back from them, we can
make the announcement.</p>
<p>TJ: It would be great to have a channel where we announce release candidates,
and have other people willing to test them subscribe to it.</p>
<p>Michael: Once we know there are binaries we can put that into our testing
queue.</p>
<p>Alexis: Microsoft doesn&#39;t have additional tests besides the ones that already
run on Jenkins.</p>

1.5.0 to float less patches.</p>
<p>TJ,Trevor: Upgrade to the latest 1.4.x, float patches and rerun the tests.</p>
<p>Trevor: We should probably make sure to integrate

<h5 id="header-vm-module">VM module<a name="vm-module" class="anchor" href="#vm-module" aria-labelledby="header-vm-module"></a></h5><p>TJ: VM module leaks a lot of memory, basically never frees any resource.</p>

For instance, issue
with profiler performance.</p>
<p>Steven: Also <a href="https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=3348">https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=3348</a>.</p>
<p>TJ: We&#39;re going to have more scenarios where we need to float patches. We need
a way to manage a queue of patches (e.g quilt). Long term solution: have a
vanilla V8 in tree and a queue of patches.</p>
<p>Alexis: Other way is to fork repositories, didn&#39;t have time to write the
proposal I talked about last time, but will do as soon as possible.</p>
<p>TJ: Problem with having our own forks is not every dependency uses Git.</p>
<h3 id="header-leap-second">Leap second<a name="leap-second" class="anchor" href="#leap-second" aria-labelledby="header-leap-second"></a></h3><p>Steven: started an FAQ on leap seconds:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/srl295/e74710ae42e8d13b96e7">https://gist.github.com/srl295/e74710ae42e8d13b96e7</a>.</p>
<p>TJ: Does faketime have a way to &quot;simulate leap seconds&quot;?</p>
<p>Julien: I don&#39;t think so, but it&#39;s worth taking a look.</p>
<p>TJ: Maybe Steven you could use that to run tests regarding leap seconds.</p>
<p>TJ: libuv uses monotonic time for all its operations. In node, the last
remaining place where we were using wall clock has been fixed in 0.10.30 or
0.10.31.</p>
<p>Trevor: libuv uses epoll_wait, does it use monotonic/hrtime on all
systems?</p>
<p>TJ: Generally yes.</p>
<p>Alexis: On Windows, for node v0.12 yes, for node v0.10 no.</p>
<p>Alexis: We can backport the hrtime fix for v0.10.</p>
<p>Michael: OpenSSL, c-ares and npm seem to use wall clock (gettimeofday).</p>
<p>TJ: Apparently c-ares uses gettimeofday only if it can&#39;t use a clock
monotonic.</p>
<p>Alexis, Steven: Potential issues with leap seconds: negative time difference,
minutes taking more than 60 seconds.</p>
<p>Julien: OpenSSL might be using wall clock not for comparing dates/times, but
for instance for inserting dates into certificates.</p>
<p>TJ: To conclude, largest concern is backporting hrtime fix to v0.10 on
windows.</p>
<p>Steven: Would be great to have a statement from V8 and OpenSSL.</p>
<h3 id="header-governance-proposal">Governance proposal<a name="governance-proposal" class="anchor" href="#governance-proposal" aria-labelledby="header-governance-proposal"></a></h3><p>TJ: I want to make sure that everyone can give feedback, so please reach out

<p>Steven, Michael: Could be useful to have a separate meeting soon to discuss
that.</p>
<p>TJ: Will find a time slot that works for everyone soon.</p>

There was
discussion with respect to how this might affect Node. From the consumer
perspective this may seen as clock drift which is quite common. In 0.12 Node
uses absolute times, not dates. 0.10.X used to use dates. Most time dependant
functions are handled by either libuv or v8. We should likely ask these
communities what they expect the effect of the leap second to be. Michael to
open a libuv issue to ask this question and also to see if we can  find who is
the right person to ask in respect to V8. Steven volunteered to write up a FAQ
covering the issue.</p>

will write up a proposal. It would be nice if tests for Node ran in the test
suites executed by the dependency teams. Failing that we should look at
pulling in the dependencies more frequently in our CI, run the Node tests and
provide feedback to the external teams.</p>

<li>Set server issue (James investigating).</li>
<li>Abort on uncaught exception (io.js issue #836 for reference).</li>
</ul>
<p>Colin raised issue of pull request to add abort to http.
Since this would change the API needs to be done in 0.14 as opposed to 0.12.
TJ suggested a work around for current releases.</p>

ABI issue, not sure if it&#39;s an actual issue or not. Would like to get more
feedback from more knowledgeable C/C++ users. Concerned by some of the
behavior changes in libuv.</p>
<p>Alexis: Users can use type casting if they have issues with the sizeof(enum)
vs sizeof(int).</p>
<p>TJ: also, probably doesn&#39;t affect a lot of packages since it affects only the

<p>Michael Dawson: Regarding porting to power, upstreamed 2 out of the three
parts. Started discussions on optimizations. Hoping to get this upstreamed
this quarter. It&#39;s gonna be a little longer for the zSeries support.</p>
<p>TJ: proposed solution: being able to run the V8 runtome as a dynamic library.
Potential issues: modules and user land code might have to perform runtime tests to
figure out if specific features in the JavaScript runtime are present.</p>
<p>Dan Shaw: How to handle Node.js&#39; JavaScript APIs using recent runtime&#39;s
capabilities (promises) that are not present in all versions of V8?</p>
<p>TJ: That&#39;s already a problem today, and this proposed solution doesn&#39;t
eliminate this problem. Maybe use the &quot;engines&quot; properties in package.json
for user land modules to express their requirements.</p>
<p>Dan Shaw: Do we need a baseline for a minimum supported set of
language/runtime level features?</p>
<p>TJ: Having a specification of a fundamental base layer on the runtime side.</p>
<p>Alexis Campailla: How to handle different versions of V8?</p>
<p>TJ: my preference would be to use something like node-addon-layer as an
abstraction layer.</p>
<p>Alexis, TJ: that would become the blessed V8/JSruntime API for binary add-ons.</p>
<p>TJ: C++ ABI has worked so far, but probably because we&#39;ve been lucky. So C API
makes more sense and would be more robust across different platforms.</p>
<p>Alexis Campailla: What about nan?</p>
<p>TJ: nan is a header only C++ library, so it wouldn&#39;t solve the case of loading
runtimes dynamically. However, as a lot of users of Node.js use nan, we might
have to provide a double abstraction.</p>
<p>Isaac Roth: All of that sounds good, but it puts a lot of burden on module
authors.</p>
<p>TJ: Bert mentioned previously that using NaCl could be interesting.</p>
<h2 id="header-issues-with-specing-what-a-node-js-runtime-baseline-is">Issues with specing what a Node.js runtime baseline is<a name="issues-with-specing-what-a-node-js-runtime-baseline-is" class="anchor" href="#issues-with-specing-what-a-node-js-runtime-baseline-is" aria-labelledby="header-issues-with-specing-what-a-node-js-runtime-baseline-is"></a></h2><p>Erik Toth: Paypal has problems with JavaScript, not with Node.js. EcmaScript
standard is a bit nebulous, and so talking about a platform identified with an
Ecma Script version is very confusing.</p>
<p>James Snell: That&#39;s why we would need a baseline spec for what would be a
compatible Node.js runtime.</p>
<p>IBM: Specs will be unsufficient, we&#39;ll need tests also.</p>
<p>TJ: Asynchronous code can be made easier to troubleshoot with using other
mechanisms than promises, for instance vasync module, or other tooling.</p>
<p>Dan Shaw: ES6 2015/2016 is coming way faster than I expected. Node.js should be
a runtime where we can run untranspiled/untransformed code. Problems with
JavaScript should be separated from problems that we have with Node.js itself.</p>
<p>Issac Roth: Promises, generators, etc. will happen anyway, so we have to
support that.</p>
<p>Issac Roth: Promises is a core abstraction, and so promises are unavoidable.</p>
<p>TJ: Problem of re-using code written for the browser which uses promises.</p>
<p>Trevor: What is the point of the discussion?</p>
<p>Trevor: The interface between the JavaScript layer and the native layer is a
mess, cleaning that up will allow to build whatever type of interface to the
code native layer.</p>
<p>Trevor: You can&#39;t transition all asynchronous APIs to promises (e.g event
emitters)</p>
<p>Trevor: 1st priority should be to refactor some core layers to use lower level
APIs to improve performance (e.g http should use tcp_wrap instead of
lib/net.js).</p>
<p>Trevor: Before supporting promises at the core layer, we&#39;d have to do some
simplification work.</p>
<p>Trevor: Supporting loading different runtimes will make supporting existing
(memory monitors, tracking GC events, etc.) tooling much more difficult.</p>
<h2 id="header-issac-roth-internationalization">Issac Roth: Internationalization<a name="issac-roth-internationalization" class="anchor" href="#issac-roth-internationalization" aria-labelledby="header-issac-roth-internationalization"></a></h2><p>Issac Roght: Ability to translate/localize error messages.</p>
<p>James Snell: One of IBM&#39;s mandate is to be able to ship code localized for 70
countries, otherwise needs to get exceptions.</p>
<p>TJ: Also, concept of cleaning up error messages/objects related to i18n of error
messages.</p>
<h2 id="header-dan-shaw-we-talked-about-abstracting-v8-what-about-libuv">Dan Shaw: We talked about abstracting V8, what about libuv?<a name="dan-shaw-we-talked-about-abstracting-v8-what-about-libuv" class="anchor" href="#dan-shaw-we-talked-about-abstracting-v8-what-about-libuv" aria-labelledby="header-dan-shaw-we-talked-about-abstracting-v8-what-about-libuv"></a></h2><p>TJ: libuv doesn&#39;t fit the same kind of niche as V8. However, an abstraction
layer would be helpful.</p>
<p>Dan Shaw: Concern of how and when Node.js will catch up with libuv?</p>
<p>TJ: At some point in the release cycle, we have to close the gates and we
can&#39;t integrate latest versions of dependencies.</p>
<p>TJ: Carefully scoped roadmap and more frequent releases should allow us to integrate
newer versions of dependencies often.</p>
<p>Isaac Roth: It will be difficult to get broad agreement on a roadmap. Usually,
open source projects work by integrating changes organically from contributors
dependening on what they want to work on.</p>
<p>TJ: Have the requirement of at any time, the tip of the development
branch can be used as a release candidate.</p>
<h2 id="header-alexis-campailla-work-to-build-all-prs-on-every-supported-platforms">Alexis Campailla: Work to build all PRs on every supported platforms.<a name="alexis-campailla-work-to-build-all-prs-on-every-supported-platforms" class="anchor" href="#alexis-campailla-work-to-build-all-prs-on-every-supported-platforms" aria-labelledby="header-alexis-campailla-work-to-build-all-prs-on-every-supported-platforms"></a></h2><p>Alexis Campailla: I&#39;ve been doing some work to be able to build/test code from
any GitHub pull request.</p>
<h2 id="header-alexis-campailla-running-benchmarks-for-windows">Alexis Campailla: Running benchmarks for Windows.<a name="alexis-campailla-running-benchmarks-for-windows" class="anchor" href="#alexis-campailla-running-benchmarks-for-windows" aria-labelledby="header-alexis-campailla-running-benchmarks-for-windows"></a></h2><p>Julien: Tracking benchmarks results across every commit would be very useful
to identify the causes of performance regressions.</p>
<p>James Snell, Michael Dawson: IBM started to run benchmarks for downstream
dependencies, and wants to do more of that.</p>
<h2 id="header-tj-cluster">TJ: cluster<a name="tj-cluster" class="anchor" href="#tj-cluster" aria-labelledby="header-tj-cluster"></a></h2><p>James: Cluster seems to be used only by 6 npm modules (grepped &#39;cluster&#39;
through 120 most used modules). However, these modules could (and probably)
use pm2 or other abstraction on top of cluster.</p>
<p>TJ: Cluster is mostly used internally by glue code.</p>
<p>Alexis: Datagram socket not supported on Windows. There&#39;s a lot of room for
improvement in the implementation.</p>
<p>Isaac: Performance of the cluster module is not satisfying, made some
comparison with nginx and cluster seems to be 3x slower. Could need a rewrite.</p>
<p>Jacob: Lots of users who directly use cluster module, sometimes by just
copy/pasting code from the doc. I would say cluster is used widely.</p>
<p>TJ: Preference would have been to improve child_process and have userland
modules implement clustering features.</p>
<h2 id="header-james-snell-crypto-improvements">James Snell: Crypto improvements<a name="james-snell-crypto-improvements" class="anchor" href="#james-snell-crypto-improvements" aria-labelledby="header-james-snell-crypto-improvements"></a></h2><p>James Snell : Better access to crypto hardware is needed.</p>
<p>TJ: libressl came out with a very compelling C API that Node.js could use.</p>
<h2 id="header-julien-gilli-stricter-apis">Julien Gilli: stricter APIs<a name="julien-gilli-stricter-apis" class="anchor" href="#julien-gilli-stricter-apis" aria-labelledby="header-julien-gilli-stricter-apis"></a></h2><p>Julien Gilli: There are a lot of fragile APIs in Node.js. It makes these APIs
hard to use correctly, and it is also very time consuming for contributors who
help users troubleshoot issues related to misuses of APIs.</p>
<p>Julien: Example of recent improvement was making net.Socket.setTimeout&#39;s API
stricter.</p>
<p>TJ: Differences between browser APIs strictness and Node.js API strictness.
It&#39;s also a documentation effort and is related to better error messages.</p>
<p>Erik Toth: Ecma has a formal type proposal that could be related.</p>
<h2 id="header-julien-gilli-lldb-v8">Julien Gilli: lldb-v8<a name="julien-gilli-lldb-v8" class="anchor" href="#julien-gilli-lldb-v8" aria-labelledby="header-julien-gilli-lldb-v8"></a></h2><p>Julien: lldb-v8 is a great tool that, if working more reliably with different
versions of node, could help both users and the core team to investigate bugs.</p>
<p>TJ: I believe IBM has another toolchain that they use.</p>
<h2 id="header-erik-toth-what-s-the-plan-with-async_wrap">Erik Toth: What&#39;s the plan with async_wrap?<a name="erik-toth-what-s-the-plan-with-async_wrap" class="anchor" href="#erik-toth-what-s-the-plan-with-async_wrap" aria-labelledby="header-erik-toth-what-s-the-plan-with-async_wrap"></a></h2><p>Dan Shaw: Gathering input from potential users currently.</p>
<p>TJ: Some interesting output from the meeting in Vancouver last summer.</p>
<p>Erik Toth: Lower level thing that we want to see where it goes.</p>
<p>Jacob: Various needs for tracing, some fairly basic (intercepting what is
logged by console.log), some much more advanced like inspecting V8 internals.
Needs to move slowly to make sure these broad needs are satisfied.</p>
<p>IBM: Performance is crucial.</p>
<p>Isaac Roth: Had to constantly reimplement tracing solutions because of
changing requirements from users. Maybe need to be very generic about this.</p>
<p>TJ: My proposed solution was to inject calls to probes that are interpreted by
platform-specific tracing frameworks (dtrace, ETW, etc.)</p>
<p>Issac Roth: Building a more generic layer that other user land modules can
build upon.</p>

node v0.12.x will break. These modules will need to be fixed on a case by case
basis.</p>
<h3 id="header-website">Website<a name="website" class="anchor" href="#website" aria-labelledby="header-website"></a></h3><p>Wyatt: security page published.</p>

express, etc.).</p>
<p>TJ: Some people have been working on downstream integration tests (for
instance, Julien with test-node-apps)</p>
<p>TJ: Downstream integration tests, downstream benchmarking desirable in the
future.</p>
<p>James: identify the top 120 most depended on modules, determine what core
modules they use, and create a tests framework around that.</p>
<p>Michael: Michael and James already have something simple that run tests for
some npm modules.</p>

refactored to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Order authors by name using a stable sort algorithm.</li>
<li>Update the .mailmap file with authors&#39; email addresses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Julien has been assigned to this and work is in progress at
<a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/9088">https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/9088</a>.</p>
<p>Participants agreed that eventually the project should have more tooling to
land changes from contributors and that these tools would also take care of
updating authors files each time a contribution is integrated in the code
repository.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/9070">recent regression in
<code>url.format</code></a>.</p>
<p>Two discussions started, one that was about what can be done before v0.12.0 is
released, and another one about what can be done post v0.12.0. Some
participants mentioned that ultimately, the goal would probably be to conform
to the whatwg spec and deprecate the current <code>url</code> module.</p>
<p>All participants agreed that before v0.12.0 is released, <code>url.format</code> should
throw on conflicting properties. Chris was assigned to this task.</p>

He mentioned that it seems to be working fine, but that he hadn&#39;t had the
opportunity to test loading additional data.</p>
<p>Robert, Steven and TJ also discussed updating the website to document how to
load additional data.</p>
<h3 id="header-website-documentation-effort">Website / Documentation effort<a name="website-documentation-effort" class="anchor" href="#website-documentation-effort" aria-labelledby="header-website-documentation-effort"></a></h3><p>Robert and TJ discussed how to to factor out the documentation from the
project. Robert also mentioned that he&#39;d like to work with Chris on the
website to integrate features/tools that are now available in io.js (for
instance, comments in documentation).</p>
<p>Robert also mentioned that he&#39;s going to check-in the website&#39;s configuration
file in source control.</p>
<h3 id="header-node-on-power-processors">Node on Power processors<a name="node-on-power-processors" class="anchor" href="#node-on-power-processors" aria-labelledby="header-node-on-power-processors"></a></h3><p>Michael Dawson from IBM talked about Node.js on PowerPC processors. TJ and
Michael agreed that the target for such a port would likely be 0.14.0. Michael
mentioned that ideally the process of upstreaming changes to V8 would be done
by that time. If not, there has been discussions recently between TJ and Chris
on refactoring the dependencies management so that maintaining floating
patches (also for other dependencies like c-ares and OpenSSL) would be easier.</p>

<h4 id="header-https-access">HTTPS access<a name="https-access" class="anchor" href="#https-access" aria-labelledby="header-https-access"></a></h4><p>Robert suggested adding HTTPS access for Node.js&#39; website. TJ mentioned that
there is already a HTTPS endpoint on the website, but that clients (browsers,
etc.) are not <em>redirected</em> by default from http to https, because doing so was
breaking a lot of people (e.g nvm).</p>
<p>Proposed solution by TJ: redirect everything by default to https except
nodejs.org/dist.</p>
<p>Robert proposed to setup a clone of the website with this change to be able to
test it.</p>
<h4 id="header-documentation-versions">Documentation versions<a name="documentation-versions" class="anchor" href="#documentation-versions" aria-labelledby="header-documentation-versions"></a></h4><p>Robert suggested a new feature for the documentation available on Node.js&#39;
website: accessing docs for different versions.</p>
<p>Robert asked if regenerating the documentation for versions older than 0.10
makes sense. TJ mentioned that we probably don&#39;t want to go back further than
0.10. However, participants agreed that in the future, publishing older
documentation could be fun and/or interesting.</p>
<p>TJ suggested that documentation generation tools could be refactored and
published as npm packages so that they can work standalone. That could make
generating documentation for different versions easier.</p>
<p>TJ also pointed out that a significant SEO effort went into making sure that
the latest Node.js documentation shows up when searching for Node
documentation, and that any change to the website&#39;s documentation should
preserve that.</p>
